From time to time I like to start things from scratch, maybe because I get tired of doing/seeing the same thing over and over. This website is an example of this: my third reboot. But this time I mean it :-).

### Old posts

I'll add my old posts here but I need to adapt them to this new design. Some of them are outdated (or bad written) and will be trashed, but most of them will appear here in the future.

### Changes

*   **Design**
    *   Clearer - color scheme based on [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized).
    *   Modern - based on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) javascript framework.
    *   Beautiful - my design and my layout, why would I think the opposite üòÅ.
*   **Backend**
    *   [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.9/), and [Werkzeug](http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/). No changes here.
    *   [Github](https://github.com/jrziviani/ziviani.net)! Oh yes! Some scripts in my webhost will fetch my changes and apply it magically.
    *   AUTO deployment!!!
*   **Editor**
    *   [VIM](http://www.vim.org) with macros and templates.
*   **To do**
    *   Add [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) for interaction.
